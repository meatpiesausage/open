# What is this? 
It's currently a server that serves a website. 

Users can login with a name and they appear on screen as a big dot. 

They can move around within the box and they can enter a message that appears as a speech bubble above their big dot.

# Getting Started
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Recent Changes

on-screen buttons for player control
text entry and speech bubbles for each player
screen set to take up the top half of the screen including:
    Mobile-Specific Improvements:
    Smaller player circles and buttons on mobile devices
    Adjusted font sizes for better readability
    Optimized touch targets for mobile interaction
    Better spacing and padding for mobile screens
    Arrow symbols (↑←→↓) for direction buttons to save space

## Requests
Make the player area fit the screen.
Holding down on the on screen button makes the player move. Maybe we try swipes instead?
